These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC 2014 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},

@article{Krishnan2000,
abstract = {This paper studies the problem of where to place network caches. Emphasis is given to caches that are transparent to the clients since they are easier to manage and they require no cooperation from the clients. Our goal is to minimize the overall flow or the average delay by placing a given number of caches in the network. We formulate these location problems both for general caches and for transparent en-route caches (TERCs), and identify that, in general, they are intractable. We give optimal algorithms for line and ring networks, and present closed form formulae for some special cases. We also present a computationally efficient dynamic programming algorithm for the single server case. This last case is of particular practical interest. It models a network that wishes to minimize the average access delay for a single web server. We experimentally study the effects of our algorithm using real web server data. We observe that a small number of TERCs are sufficient to reduce the network traffic significantly. Furthermore, there is a surprising consistency over time in the relative amount of web traffic from the server along a path, lending a stability to our TERC location solution. Our techniques can be used by network providers to reduce traffic load in their network},

@article{Hasan2014,
abstract = {Content delivery networks (CDNs) deploy globally distributed systems of caches in a large number of autonomous systems (ASes). It is important for a CDN operator to satisfy the performance requirements of end users, while minimizing the cache deployment cost. In this paper, we study the cache deployment optimization (CaDeOp) problem of determining how much server, energy, and bandwidth resources to provision in each cache AS, i.e., each AS chosen for cache deployment. The CaDeOp objective is to minimize the total cost incurred by the CDN, subject to meeting the end-user performance requirements. We formulate the CaDeOp problem as a mixed integer program (MIP) and solve it for realistic AS-level topologies, traffic demands, and non-linear energy and bandwidth costs. We also evaluate the sensitivity of the results to our parametric assumptions. When the end-user performance requirements become more stringent, the CDN footprint rapidly expands, requiring cache deployments in additional ASes and geographical regions. Also, the CDN cost increases several times, with the cost balance shifting toward bandwidth and energy costs. On the other hand, the traffic distribution among the cache ASes stays relatively even, with the top 20{\%} of the cache ASes serving around 30{\%} of the overall traffic.},

@article{Borst2010,
abstract = {The delivery of video content is expected to gain huge momentum, fueled by the popularity of user-generated clips, growth of VoD libraries, and wide-spread deployment of IPTV services with features such as CatchUp/PauseLive TV and NPVR capabilities. The `time-shifted' nature of these personalized applications defies the broadcast paradigm underlying conventional TV networks, and increases the overall bandwidth demands by orders of magnitude. Caching strategies provide an effective mechanism for mitigating these massive bandwidth requirements by replicating the most popular content closer to the network edge, rather than storing it in a central site. The reduction in the traffic load lessens the required transport capacity and capital expense, and alleviates performance bottlenecks. In the present paper, we develop light-weight cooperative cache management algorithms aimed at maximizing the traffic volume served from cache and minimizing the bandwidth cost. As a canonical scenario, we focus on a cluster of distributed caches, either connected directly or via a parent node, and formulate the content placement problem as a linear program in order to benchmark the globally optimal performance. Under certain symmetry assumptions, the optimal solution of the linear program is shown to have a rather simple structure. Besides interesting in its own right, the optimal structure offers valuable guidance for the design of low-complexity cache management and replacement algorithms. We establish that the performance of the proposed algorithms is guaranteed to be within a constant factor from the globally optimal performance, with far more benign worst-case ratios than in prior work, even in asymmetric scenarios. Numerical experiments for typical popularity distributions reveal that the actual performance is far better than the worst-case conditions indicate.},

@article{Leconte2016,
abstract = {This paper addresses a fundamental limitation for the adoption of caching for wireless access networks due to small population sizes. This shortcoming is due to two main challenges: (i) making timely estimates of varying content popularity and (ii) inferring popular content from small samples. We propose a framework which alleviates such limitations. To timely estimate varying popularity in a context of a single cache we propose an Age-Based Threshold (ABT) policy which caches all contents requested more times than a threshold {\$}\backslashwidetilde N(\backslashtau){\$}, where {\$}\backslashtau{\$} is the content age. We show that ABT is asymptotically hit rate optimal in the many contents regime, which allows us to obtain the first characterization of the optimal performance of a caching system in a dynamic context. We then address small sample sizes focusing on {\$}L{\$} local caches and one global cache. On the one hand we show that the global cache learns L times faster by aggregating all requests from local caches, which improves hit rates. On the other hand, aggregation washes out local characteristics of correlated traffic which penalizes hit rate. This motivates coordination mechanisms which combine global learning of popularity scores in clusters and LRU with prefetching.},

@article{Qin,
abstract = {The Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model, which predicts the current value of a time series based upon its previous values as well as the current and past values of multiple driving (exoge-nous) series, has been studied for decades. De-spite the fact that various NARX models have been developed, few of them can capture the long-term temporal dependencies appropriately and select the relevant driving series to make predictions. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage attention-based re-current neural network (DA-RNN) to address these two issues. In the first stage, we introduce an in-put attention mechanism to adaptively extract rel-evant driving series (a.k.a., input features) at each time step by referring to the previous encoder hid-den state. In the second stage, we use a temporal attention mechanism to select relevant encoder hid-den states across all time steps. With this dual-stage attention scheme, our model can not only make predictions effectively, but can also be easily in-terpreted. Thorough empirical studies based upon the SML 2010 dataset and the NASDAQ 100 Stock dataset demonstrate that the DA-RNN can outper-form state-of-the-art methods for time series pre-diction.},
